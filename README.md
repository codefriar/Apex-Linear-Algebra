Apex-Linear-Algebra
===================

This project provides a series of classes for doing linear algebra within the Salesforce Apex language.

Motivation
----------

Linear Algebra and in particular vector mathematics are becoming increasingly useful for newer development requirements around implementing machine learning and data mining systems. Salesforce has an architectural system that will allow it to efficiently process large volumes of data in a batch sequence however does not have the required mathematical libraries to allow developers to build such systems. This library aims to provide that.

In particular this library will be built for providing the mathematical functionality needed for my Dreamforce 2014 talk "Building Machine Learning Systems With Apex". It is released as open source so that anybody may use it as they desire for building more complicated mathematical constructs.
